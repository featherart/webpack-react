// Normally we wouldn't need a separate .babelrc file since we run the babel transpiler
// through webpack. However we need this in order to be able to write ES6 in the
// webpack config files.
// In addition, our testing harness (mocha or jest) would normally not be run
// through webpack, so this would be required to be able to write or testing any
// components or code written in es6.
// If you append the config files with 'babel', it will trigger babel-register
// and webpack will transpile via the interpret module.
// eg. webpack.config.js vs webpack.config.babel.js
